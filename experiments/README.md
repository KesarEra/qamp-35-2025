# Experiments and Early Work

This folder contains early explorations and experiments conducted during the QAMP 35 project.

## Structure

- **early_attempts/**: Initial attempts at defining quantum gates and proving basic properties
  - `h_mul_h_eq_id.lean`: First proof that H² = I using custom matrix definitions
  - `h_mul_h_eq_id_with_time_profile.lean`: Performance profiling of the proof
  - `CoreTypes.lean`: Early type definitions
  - `SingleQubitGateDefinitions.lean`: Initial gate definitions
  - `SingleQubitGateInteraction/`: Early gate interaction experiments

These files are kept for historical reference but are superseded by the current working code in the main `Qamp352025/` directory.
